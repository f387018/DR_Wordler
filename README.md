Code for generating guesses to solve NYT's Wordle puzzle

This code uses a dictionary (credit another GIT user)
The way it works is as follows:
1. It generates the first guess
2. You input it into the puzzle and see the response
3. Input the "green", "yellow", "black" sequence from the puzzle at the prompt
4. The code generates a new suggestion
5. This repeats until you, hopefully, solve the puzzle
